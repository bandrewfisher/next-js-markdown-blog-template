Just add any images you want to add in your posts to the `public` folder.

## Code Blocks

You can write code inline like `console.log("Hello World!");` or include larger blocks of code, complete with syntax highlighting:

}

```

This template supports Markup, HTML, CSS, C, JavaScript, Python, and Bash out of the box. If you'd like syntax highlighting support for additional languages, then select the languages you need from the [Prims JS website](https://prismjs.com/download.html), download the CSS file, and replace the `app/prism.css` file in this project.
